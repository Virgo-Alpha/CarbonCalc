# Carbon Calc - Carbon Footprint Calculator

Welcome to the Carbon Calc - Carbon Footprint Calculator! This Streamlit app allows users to estimate their carbon footprint based on the distance traveled between two cities. Additionally, it provides information on the environmental impact by calculating the potential harm to wildlife in terms of the number of animals that would be affected.

## How to Use

1. **Select Cities:** Use the sidebar to choose the departure and destination cities from the available options.

2. **Calculate:** Click the "Calculate" button to perform the calculations.

3. **View Results:** The app will display the total distance traveled, the amount of carbon emitted, and the potential harm to wildlife in terms of the number of animals affected.

## Features

- **User Input:** The sidebar provides an intuitive interface for users to input their departure and destination cities.

- **Carbon Emission Calculation:** The app uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between the selected cities and estimates the carbon emissions based on the distance.
